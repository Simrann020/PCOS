        <h2>üî∑ What is Ensemble Learning?</h2>
        
        <p>
            Ensemble Learning is a powerful machine learning strategy where multiple individual models (often called "weak learners") are combined together 
            to create a stronger, more accurate predictive model. Instead of relying on just one model‚Äôs predictions, ensemble methods leverage the wisdom of multiple models to improve performance, 
            reduce overfitting, and enhance generalization to new data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The idea is simple: by aggregating different models, we can minimize the chances of making large errors and build a more robust system overall. 
            Common ensemble techniques include <strong>Bagging</strong> (e.g., Random Forest), <strong>Boosting</strong> (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), and <strong>Voting Classifiers</strong>.

        <h3>üß† How Ensemble Applies to PCOS Prediction</h3>
        <p>
            For this project, Ensemble Learning methods were used to strengthen PCOS prediction models. 
            By combining multiple models (like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM) into Voting Classifiers and experimenting with Random Forests and Boosting techniques, 
            we enhanced model accuracy and robustness on the PCOS dataset.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The ensemble methods helped balance prediction performance across both PCOS-positive and PCOS-negative classes, 
            overcoming biases that sometimes occur when using a single model alone. This resulted in improved overall model reliability and better handling of diverse patient profiles.
        </p>
    
        <h3>üìã Method Used in This Project</h3>
<p>
    For this project, we focused on using the <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong> as our primary Ensemble Learning method. 
    Random Forest is based on the Bagging approach, where multiple Decision Trees are trained on different random subsets of the data, 
    and their predictions are averaged (for regression) or voted (for classification) to produce the final output.
</p>

<p>
    This method helped in reducing overfitting compared to a single Decision Tree, improving the overall prediction accuracy on the PCOS dataset. 
    Random Forest also provided valuable insights into feature importance, helping us identify which clinical features were the most influential in predicting PCOS.

        <h2>üå≥ Ensemble Learning (Random Forest) - Data Preparation & Code</h2>
    
        <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Core PCOS Dataset Preparation</h3>
        <p>
            For the Ensemble Learning model (specifically Random Forest Classifier), we worked with the <strong>Core PCOS Cleaned Dataset</strong>. 
            The process involved thorough cleaning and feature selection to ensure that the dataset was numeric and properly labeled, making it ideal for ensemble modeling.
        </p>
    
        <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaned Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            The preprocessing steps included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Removing unnecessary whitespace from column names.</li>
            <li>Selecting key features such as <strong>Age (yrs)</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, <strong>hair growth</strong>, <strong>Hair loss</strong>, <strong>Pimples</strong>, and the target <strong>PCOS (Y/N)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Encoding categorical variables (Y/N) into binary numeric values (0 for No, 1 for Yes).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Below is a snapshot of the dataset before cleaning:</p>

        <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Sample Train and Test Data</h3>
        <p>
            After cleaning, the data was split into <strong>80% training</strong> and <strong>20% testing</strong> subsets using scikit-learn‚Äôs <code>train_test_split</code>. 
            This disjoint split ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on completely different sets of data, enabling a reliable assessment of performance.

        <h2>üìà Random Forest Classifier Results</h2>
    
        <p>
            After training the Random Forest model on the Core PCOS dataset, we evaluated its performance using the confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance plot.
        </p>
    
        <h3>‚úÖ Confusion Matrix</h3>
        <div class="image-container-ensemble">
            <img src="../assests/ensemble_confusion.png" alt="Random Forest Confusion Matrix" class="ensemble-image">
        </div>
        <p>
            The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly identified 139 non-PCOS patients and 22 PCOS patients. However, 47 PCOS cases were missed, and 9 non-PCOS cases were incorrectly predicted as PCOS.
        </p>
    
        <h3>üìÑ Classification Report</h3>
        <div class="image-container-ensemble">

        </div>
        <p>
            The classification report highlights precision and recall values. 
            The model had high precision for both classes but struggled with recall for PCOS cases, indicating that it tends to miss some true PCOS cases.
        </p>
    
        <h3>üåü Feature Importance Plot</h3>
        <div class="image-container-ensemble">

            This bar chart displays which features were most important in predicting PCOS. Features like <strong>Hair Growth</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, and <strong>Age</strong> played major roles in influencing the model‚Äôs decisions.

        <h2>üîç Conclusion: Ensemble Learning with Random Forest</h2>
    
        <p>
            The Random Forest Classifier provided strong and reliable results for predicting PCOS from the Core PCOS Dataset. 
            With an overall accuracy of <strong>74%</strong>, it demonstrated good generalization capabilities across both training and testing data.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The confusion matrix and classification report revealed that the model performed very well in predicting the majority class (non-PCOS), 
            but had some difficulty correctly identifying all PCOS cases, resulting in moderate false negatives. 
            This is common in medical datasets where imbalanced classes or overlapping symptoms exist.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Feature importance analysis showed that clinical indicators such as <strong>Age</strong>, <strong>BMI</strong>, and <strong>hair growth</strong> played major roles in the model‚Äôs decision-making, 
            providing valuable insights into the key factors associated with PCOS risk.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Overall, Random Forest proved to be an effective ensemble method, benefiting from its ability to combine multiple decision trees to improve robustness and reduce overfitting. 
            Its performance was comparable to simpler models like Decision Trees and SVMs, but with improved stability across different splits.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In future iterations, fine-tuning hyperparameters (such as number of trees, depth of trees, and feature sampling) could further boost model accuracy and sensitivity to better capture PCOS-positive cases.
