        <h2>Understanding Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</h2>

                    Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women of reproductive age. It is a complex condition that impacts various aspects of health, including menstrual cycles, fertility, metabolism, and mental well-being. Despite its prevalence, many women remain undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PCOS is characterized by hormonal imbalances, irregular menstrual cycles, and the presence of small cysts on the ovaries. It can also lead to other long-term health complications, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and infertility. This project aims to analyze PCOS trends, predict potential diagnoses, and explore factors contributing to this condition.

                    The significance of addressing PCOS goes beyond reproductive health. This condition is closely linked to insulin resistance, which affects the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels. As a result, women with PCOS often experience weight gain, difficulty losing weight, and an increased risk of developing metabolic disorders.

                    Additionally, hormonal fluctuations associated with PCOS can cause acne, excessive hair growth (hirsutism), and hair thinning, leading to emotional distress and reduced self-esteem. This study seeks to understand how lifestyle factors, genetics, and medical treatments impact PCOS.

                    PCOS does not have a single known cause, but research suggests that genetic and environmental factors play a crucial role. Studies indicate that PCOS can run in families, meaning that if a close relative has it, the chances of developing the condition may be higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and stress levels can influence the severity of symptoms. Early diagnosis and intervention are essential for managing PCOS effectively and reducing its long-term health risks.

                    Over the years, medical research has focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms of PCOS and developing effective treatment strategies. Traditional treatment options include hormonal birth control to regulate menstrual cycles, medications like metformin to manage insulin resistance, and lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise.

                <p>
                    Despite advancements in medical research, PCOS remains underdiagnosed and often misunderstood. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to improve PCOS detection, prediction, and management, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for millions of women worldwide.
