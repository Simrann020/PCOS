    <!-- PCA Overview -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)?</h2>
        <p>
            Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while retaining the most important variance. By transforming correlated features into a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) variables called principal components, PCA simplifies data analysis and enhances model interpretability.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Use PCA in PCOS Prediction?</h3>
        <p>
            In the context of PCOS prediction, datasets often contain multiple features, some of which may be redundant or contribute little useful information. PCA helps in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing dimensionality, which improves computational efficiency.</li>
            <li>Eliminating multicollinearity, leading to better machine learning performance.</li>
            <li>Enhancing visualization, making it easier to explore patterns in the data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Illustration of PCA Transformation</h3>
<p>
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms high-dimensional data into a new set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components. 
    This transformation helps in reducing complexity while maintaining the most important information in the dataset. 
</p>

<p>
    The first principal component (PC1) captures the maximum variance in the data, followed by the second principal component (PC2), and so on. 
    These new components are linear combinations of the original features, arranged in decreasing order of importance.
</p>

<h3>Why is PCA Important?</h3>

</div>
<ul>

    <li>PCA helps visualize patterns in data by projecting it into lower-dimensional spaces like 2D or 3D.</li>
    <li>It removes redundancy and correlations among features, making models more efficient.</li>
    <li>PCA reduces overfitting by selecting only the most informative components.</li>
    <li>It improves computational performance by eliminating unnecessary dimensions.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Understanding Variance Explained</h3>
<div class="image-container">
    <img src="../assests//variance.png" alt="Variance Explained by PCA" class="pcos-image" onclick="openImage(this)">
</div>

<p>
    The variance explained by each principal component indicates how much information from the original dataset is retained. 
    The first few components typically capture most of the variance, allowing us to discard the rest without significant information loss.
</p>

<p>
    The graph on the right shows how the variance accumulates across principal components. 
    The elbow point on the curve suggests the optimal number of components to keep for analysis while maintaining the majority of the dataset’s information.
</p>


        <p>
            The first few principal components capture most of the dataset's variance, allowing us to reduce the number of dimensions while preserving essential information.

    <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to several PCOS-related datasets to reduce dimensionality and explore patterns in the data. Below are the results of 2D and 3D PCA projections:</p>

        <h2>Data Preparation for PCA</h2>
        <p>We selected four PCOS-related datasets and preprocessed them to retain only numerical features.</p>
        
        <h3>1️⃣ Core PCOS Dataset</h3>

    <h3>4️⃣ PCOS Medication Reactions</h3>

    <h3>PCA on PCOS Medication Reactions</h3>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> PCA could not be applied to the PCOS Medication Reactions dataset. This is because the dataset primarily contains categorical data, which PCA, a linear method for continuous variables, is not suited to handle directly.</p>

    <!-- Eigenvalues & Variance Retention -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>Eigenvalues & Variance Retention</h2>
        <p>To understand how well PCA captures the variability in the dataset, we analyzed the eigenvalues and the variance explained by each principal component.</p>
    
        <h3>Explained Variance by Principal Components</h3>
        <p>The table below shows the percentage of variance retained when reducing the dataset to two and three principal components.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../assests/PCA_Variance.png" alt="PCA Explained Variance" class="pcos-image" onclick="openImage(this)">
        </div>
    
        <ul>
            <li>The Global PCOS Demographics dataset retains 66.92% of its variance in 2D and 100% in 3D.</li>
            <li>The Lifestyle & Diet Dataset retains 29.26% in 2D and 38.12% in 3D, indicating a more diverse feature set.</li>
            <li>The Core PCOS Dataset retains 19.75% in 2D and 26.11% in 3D, requiring more components to preserve key information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This analysis confirms that the Global PCOS Demographics dataset benefits most from PCA, while other datasets require additional components to retain meaningful variance.</p>
    
        <h3>Top Eigenvalues</h3>
        <p>Eigenvalues represent the amount of variance captured by each principal component. The higher the eigenvalue, the more significant that component is in explaining the dataset’s variance.</p>
    
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="../assests/PCA_Eigen.png" alt="PCA Eigenvalues" class="pcos-image" onclick="openImage(this)">
        </div>
    
        <ul>
            <li>For Global PCOS Demographics, the first three eigenvalues are approximately 1.007, 0.999, and 0.992, showing a gradual decline in importance.</li>
            <li>The Lifestyle & Diet Dataset's top three eigenvalues are 2.88, 1.80, and 1.42, reflecting moderate information retention.</li>
            <li>The Core PCOS Dataset has eigenvalues of 5.25, 3.44, and 2.80, indicating that its first few components are highly significant.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>These eigenvalues validate our earlier findings: datasets with a smaller spread of eigenvalues (like Global PCOS Demographics) are more effectively compressed into fewer dimensions, while others may require additional components for optimal variance retention.</p>
